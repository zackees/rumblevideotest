WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good evening and happy obedience to you.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.560
Our top story tonight,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.440
why are young people dying suddenly all the time?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.800
It must be old age, moving along.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.880
In other news, the nation continues to be plagued

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280
by dangerous conspiracy theorists

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.880
who are spreading baseless false claims

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760
that there's something called natural immunity.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.840
While there's certainly no science

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.480
to substantiate this harmful misinformation,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.100
the conspiracy theorists believe what they call
God

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.120
just gave them this alleged natural immunity.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.800
These extremists with a lion-like mentality

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
are being rather noncompliant

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.560
with our pharmaceutical business plan,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.400
and that's not good for anybody,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.920
especially our shareholders.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.240
So don't be a moron, and for God's sakes,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.640
please don't be a lion.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.400
We at the establishment would like to cordially
invite you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.920
to feel afraid so you can increase your levels of
obedience

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.200
with our extremely well-tested,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.840
safe and effective route of immunity.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.960
It's the only way, and all for your protection, of
course.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.800
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.960
I've got to go cash some checks I was given

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.560
for selling my soul.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760
There actually is another way.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.640
Introducing Fierce Immunity by Rebel Lion.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.960
Fierce immunity is made for the lions of the
world,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.340
and at Rebel Lions, we believe that health equals
freedom,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.360
and your immune system is the constitution of your
health.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.160
With all the deception about health

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.780
and immunity in the world,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.240
we at Rebel Lion believe it's time for a change.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.760
That's why we bring integrity down to the
molecule.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640
Every ingredient in Fierce Immunity has a precise
purpose,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.000
and also how our ingredients synergistically

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.160
work together contains a sacred code of sorts

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
that unlocks mechanisms in your body

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.940
so it can help repair and strengthen your
immunity.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.240
If you're someone who doesn't wanna leave your
health

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.000
and wellbeing to the mercy of all the deception
out there,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080
you are a Rebel Lion, and you're in the right
place.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.720
I'd like to invite you to grab a bottle of Fierce
Immunity

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.720
It's time to get fierce.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.080
I was raised in California by a single mom

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.320
who did her best to care for four children on her
own.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.420
As a child of the welfare state,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.800
I witnessed firsthand what happens to the psyche

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.200
and spirit of those who become dependent

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.840
on government assistance.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240
Had my mother known the difference

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.600
between a hand up and a hand out,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.100
she may have avoided the trap

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.480
that kept us living on the edge of poverty

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.980
like so many people are today.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.740
Living in fear of losing her welfare assistance,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.520
Mom remained single and lonely

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.320
until the day she passed at 58 years young.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.760
Her life was cut short

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.920
by a combination of toxic cancer treatments and
grief.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.360
Just 34 days before she passed,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.400
her first son, my brother,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.300
was killed by a drug called AZT.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.540
Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.640
as a result of that prescribed poison.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.240
The pusher of AZT was none other than Dr. Anthony
Fauci.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.740
The reason that only one drug has been made
available, AZT,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.880
because it's the only drug that has been shown

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.320
to be safe and effective.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.380
Well, it's certainly nice to know

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.280
that the future looks brighter.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.220
Thirty years later, there he was again.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.000
Same script, same actors, same performance.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.940
These are safe and effective products.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.840
Knowing what that man had done in the 80s and 90s,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.640
I couldn't believe he was still in a position of
such power.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.600
Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame!

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.780
Fire Fauci, fire Fauci, fire Fauci, fire Fauci,
fire Fauci!

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.380
As the world descended into synchronized tyranny,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.760
I began to ask myself,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.560
how did they get everyone to go along with this?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Oh, it feels so good.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.600
I know.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.360
Obsessed with finding the answer,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.060
I began studying every moment in recorded history

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.040
where masses of people devolved into a state of
self-destruction.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080
Down that rabbit hole was where I discovered

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.980
the work of G. Edward Griffin.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.940
Ladies and gentlemen, again let me say welcome to
our home.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.380
Since the 1960s, Mr. Griffin has been warning the
world

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.020
of the communist plot to overtake America.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.020
Yes, I know, communism.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.400
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.400
That thing we've all been told fell with the
Berlin Wall.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.540
How do you measure such an astonishing moment in
history?

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.340
It was Napoleon who said,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.780
history is a lie agreed upon.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.240
Ironically, there's no evidence that Napoleon ever
said that.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.320
As we're about to discover together,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.680
much of our history has been rewritten to serve an
agenda

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.160
that up until recently was invisible to the
average person.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.260
Average like this guy.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.060
Everyone's talking about the necessity for change
right now,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.660
particularly here in the U.S.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.660
Over the past few months, as a filmmaker,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.700
I've had the honor of documenting a political
revolution.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.200
That was me in 2016, the year of my political
awakening.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.080
Come on board the political revolution.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.440
I was touring with the Bernie Sanders campaign,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.320
creating media to help his grassroots movement
grow.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.220
At that time, I knew very little about socialism

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.460
and even less about democratic socialism.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.200
As it turned out, I wasn't the only one.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.100
So, my Bernie bros, how do we redistribute wealth

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.700
through taxation without expanding the powers

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.700
of the federal government?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.940
Bernie f***ing Sanders!

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.440
Whoo!

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.040
Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.220
As confusion set in, I began turning my questions
inward.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.820
Are they hypnotized?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.120
Am I hypnotized?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.800
That question, that one simple question,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.340
activated some strange sort of faith healing.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.200
Suddenly, I could see.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.880
How did I not see this before?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.140
There were so many red flags.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.620
The only solution is communist revolution!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.120
The only solution is communist revolution!

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.560
The only solution is communist revolution!

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.000
That's right, we need communists!

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.800
That's what we need!

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.600
I'm well aware that whether you're here in person

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.100
or through the medium of motion picture,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.780
that for most of you, it's not easy to fit
meetings

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.140
of this kind into your schedules.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.940
But the fact that you are here indicates

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.940
that you do have an interest in the subject.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.020
So, in order not to waste any of your time,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.860
let's dispense with the usual preliminaries

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.860
and get right down to the business at hand.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.820
We're going to examine, first of all,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.860
the communist theory and practice of revolution,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.860
particularly as applied to the United States.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.860
Now, this will not be something dreamed up out of
thin air.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.880
This will be the strategy as taught by them

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.880
and advocated by them in their own manuals,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.880
in their textbooks, and in their schools.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.880
The new program of the Communist Party

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.880
on this subject has this decision.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.880
The term socialism describes but the first stage

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.900
of a new society that, in its full development,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.900
is called communism.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.900
Socialism is a transitional stage.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.900
Jim Carrey, everyone.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.900
I went out today and bought me some
freedom-friendly Nikes.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.900
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.900
That's a salute to Colin Kaepernick, to Nike.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.920
Congratulations on your fantastic choice.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.920
Thank you so much.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.920
It's good to be back in dystopian America.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.920
The Republicans are running with the word
socialism.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
They're trying to say...

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.920
They're trying to scare people.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920
Scare people.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920
It's communism.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920
Venezuela, Trump says.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920
We're going to be living in Venezuela.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920
I grew up in Canada.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.940
I'm here to tell you that this bullshit line that
you get

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.940
on all of the political shows from people

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.940
is that it's a failure.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.940
The system is a failure in Canada.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.940
It is not a failure in America.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.940
It is a failure in Canada.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.940
It is not a failure in Canada.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.940
I never waited for anything in my life.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940
I chose my own doctors.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.940
My mother never paid for a prescription.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.960
It was fantastic.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960
And I just got back from Vancouver,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960
and I keep hearing this, like,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960
Canadians are so nice.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960
Canadians are so nice.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.960
They can be nice because they have health care.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.960
Because they have a government that cares about
them.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.960
In Canada, the authorities say there's now a state
of emergency.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.960
The year swept through Canada's capital.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.980
The day police in Ottawa used pecans and pepper
spray.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.980
They just trampled on me.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.980
Look what you did to her!

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.980
Medical wait times in this country are longer than
ever.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.980
The cost of living just keeps climbing.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.980
There's a socialist coup unfolding in Canada,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.980
and we taxpayers are funding it.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.980
In the recent years, a lot of Canadians have been
watching

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.980
their once well-regarded country become what some

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.000
are even calling tyrannical.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
A country previously hailed as the most free and

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
democratic in the world.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now, the People's World, the official West Coast
newspaper

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of the Communist Party, ran this rather
interesting editorial.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
What is needed now is an effort that begins to
approximate

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.020
the magnitude of the problem.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.020
As a minimum, such a program should demand

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.020
massive emergency action by the federal
government.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.020
The federal government has invoked the Emergencies
Act.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.020
As of today, a bank or other financial service
provider

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.040
will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an
account

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.040
without a court order.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.040
If you are involved in this protest, we will
actively

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.040
look to identify you and follow up with financial

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.040
sanctions and criminal charges.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.040
Banks have already started to freeze the accounts

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.040
of people involved in the protest.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040
Please get out.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.040
Immediately get out.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.040
Intimidating people in a church during the
Passover.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.060
Unbelievable.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.060
Growing up under communist dictatorship,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.060
I have been warning Canadians that that's what's
coming.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.060
I could smell it.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.060
I could see it at every corner.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.060
We will not put up with this anymore.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.060
We are fighting back.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.060
Protests, public protests, are an important part
of making

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.060
sure we're getting messages out there.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:19.080
But using protests to demand changes to public
policy

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.080
is something that I think is worrisome.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.080
Okay.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.080
So here we have the Prime Minister of Canada

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.080
saying that yes, we have a highly functioning
democracy

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.080
and they have the right and freedom to protest.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.100
However, if those protests are used to demand
change

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.100
in government policy, then no.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:46.100
The small fringe minority who are holding
unacceptable

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.100
views that they're expressing...

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.100
Freedom!

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.100
Freedom!

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.120
...do not represent the views of Canadians who
know

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.120
that following the science and stepping up to
protect

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.120
each other is the best way to continue to ensure

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.120
our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.140
Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claims to be

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.140
following the science, but Trudeau's science often

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.140
comes in the form of this bizarre authoritarian
technocracy.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.140
I think that Justin Trudeau stepped on the
landmine

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.140
when he weaponized the banking system in Canada

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.140
against the truckers.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.160
Those peaceful trucker protests, you know, their
most violent

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
act was honking their horns.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
And in retaliation, they had their access

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
to their bank accounts, and anybody that supported
them

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
in any way had their access to bank accounts
eliminated.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
And at that moment in time, we all came to realize

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
what was really going down.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.180
Even with Sun TV watching for any slip, he was
asked

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.180
which country he most admired and referred to
China.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.180
The level of admiration I actually have for China,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:16.180
because their basic dictatorship is allowing
them...

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.180
I applaud China for stepping up...

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.180
Excuse me, I applaud Canada.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.200
You can tell what I'm thinking.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.200
A prime minister who openly admires the Chinese

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.200
basic dictatorship, who tramples on fundamental
rights

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200
by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.200
as terrorists just because they dared to stand up

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.200
to his perverted concept of democracy,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.220
should not be allowed to speak in this house at
all.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.220
Mr. Trudeau, please spare us your presence.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.220
Thank you.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.220
Canadians know where I stand.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.220
This is a moment for responsible leaders to think
carefully

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.220
about where they stand and who they stand with.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.220
While Justin Trudeau makes a compelling case
study,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.240
he is not the only dictator on the rise.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.240
Under the new rules provided by the COVID-19
emergency,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.240
many other elected leaders were empowered

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.240
to show their true colors.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.240
Interesting how they all marched in perfect
lockstep

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240
while chanting the same slogans.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.240
This pandemic has provided an opportunity...

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.240
We are now in an economy in crisis,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.240
but with an incredible opportunity.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.240
It's certainly a major crisis,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.240
but it also offers us a unique opportunity.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.240
Unprecedented opportunity.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.240
To rethink and reset.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.240
A great opportunity for reset.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.240
Opportunity for us to reset.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.240
For a reset.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.240
It's almost as if they all attended the same
school of thought

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.240
and studied under the same professor.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.240
Some people would say,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.240
this revolution is characterized

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.240
by the fight of robots against human beings.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.240
And we will win this fight.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.240
Professor Klaus Schwab was born in 1938 in
Ravensburg, Germany,

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.240
where Nazi crimes against humanity were committed.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.240
His father, Jürgen Schwab,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.240
was the managing director of Escher-Weiss
Ravensburg,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.240
a company that used slave labor

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.240
to manufacture weapons of war for the Third Reich.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.240
While Klaus's father was at the helm,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.240
the Nazi Party awarded Escher-Weiss Ravensburg

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.240
the title of National Socialist Model Company.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.240
Years later, Klaus Schwab joined the board of
directors

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.240
at Escher-Weiss Ravensburg.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.240
Where he played a key role in the development of
South Africa's nuclear weapons program

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.240
during the darkest years of the racist apartheid
regime.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.240
Today, Klaus Schwab is the founder and executive
chairman

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.240
of the World Economic Forum.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.240
If you'd like to meet the people who are supposed
to repair the state of the world,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.240
or give a piece of your mind to the bankers who
helped get us into this mess,

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.240
we can tell you where to find a lot of them.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.240
The World Economic Forum.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.240
Founded in 1971,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.240
the World Economic Forum is an international
private organization

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.240
which receives billions of tax-free dollars

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.240
from its members and their global enterprises.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.240
Every year, the WEF brings together its members
with world leaders,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.240
big pharma executives, tech titans, Hollywood
celebrities,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.240
media personalities, and internet influencers

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.240
to meet in the secluded mountains of Davos,
Switzerland.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.240
It is a tiny town folded into the Swiss Alps,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.240
a village where you could bump into Bill Clinton,
Bill Gates,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.240
the head of Google, and the Queen of Jordan, all
in one place.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.240
A lot of reporters cover the forum, but few get
inside.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.240
It turns out there are two Davoses.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.240
One you see, and one you don't.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.240
After hours, there are hundreds of private parties
where deals are done.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.240
People who can't be seen together in public can
meet here.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.240
Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.240
distinguished heads of state and government,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.240
the future is built by us.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.240
The future is built by us,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.240
by a powerful community as you here in this room.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.240
Klaus Schwab, the founder of the WEF, is
particularly up front

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.240
and even proud of his ability to shape and
influence world politics.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.240
I created the community of global shapers

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.240
as a means, as a force, to shape our common
future.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.240
And of course, their Global Young Leaders program
is a grooming ground

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.240
so that when they ultimately infiltrate cabinets,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
we penetrate the cabinets,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240
they will likely tend to govern a certain way.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.240
Nobody will be safe if not everybody is
vaccinated.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.240
The names in the countries he mentioned

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.240
ended up being some of the most dystopian and
authoritative during this pandemic.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.240
Names like Ms. Merkel, Vladimir Putin, and so on.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.240
Other names? Jacinda Ardern, Sebastian Kurz,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.240
Mauricio Macri, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.240
Gavin Newsom, Stéphane Bancel, Chelsea Clinton,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.240
Leonardo DiCaprio, Sanjay Gupta, Dr. Liana Nguyen,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.240
Alexander and Jonathan Soros, George Soros' sons,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.240
and several of the Rothschilds.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240
And of course...

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:40.240
Now who could represent such a world better than
you, Prime Minister?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.240
In 2014, Klaus Schwab called for the Great Reset.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.240
We need a Great Reset.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.240
Which he positioned as the solution to the world's
most urgent issues.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.240
The dark reality of Schwab's agenda is detailed in
his best-selling book,

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.240
COVID-19, The Great Reset.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.240
His in-game mission is to replace independent
governance

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.240
with a top-down control, one world government,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.240
and a central bank-controlled digital currency.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.240
When they say, you'll be happy,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.240
what they mean is, you'll be enslaved.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.240
That's why they're talking about a Great Reset.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.240
That's why they're talking about introducing this
quasi-communist,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240
quasi-socialist agenda.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.240
They know we've run the course where we cannot
continue

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.240
down the path of the ever-increasing indebtedness,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.240
because we have a generation that quite literally
cannot afford to buy a house.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.240
Millions of Americans are priced out of buying a
home.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.240
And so it's easy to tell that generation,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.240
we're going to forgive your college debt.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.240
Student debt relief.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.240
And set your expectations lower.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
You're going to rent forever.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240
We're going to celebrate the tiny house movement.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.240
We're going to do all of these things which sound
cool,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240
because they're shaping our narrative

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.240
so that we become capable of expecting less.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.240
What we need to do is not expect less.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.240
We need to remove inefficiencies so we can
experience more.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.240
And that's the subtle distinction that the Great
Reset is missing.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.240
Like most globalists, Schwab regards communist
China

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.240
as a shining model of how he intends to transform
the world.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.240
We now welcome His Excellency Xi Jinping.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:38.240
China has made significant economic and social
achievements under your leadership.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240
Chinese influence on global affairs is growing.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.240
The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus
Schwab,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.240
says that this is what motivated the group this
year

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.240
to invite President Xi Jinping to deliver the
keynote address in Davos.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.240
Schwab said Xi's presence was a sign of the shift
from a unipolar world

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.240
dominated by the United States to a more
multipolar system

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.240
in which rising powers like China will have a step
up and play a bigger role.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.240
I think it's a role model for many countries,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.240
but we have to go one step further.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.240
It's a systemic transformation of the world.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.240
Artificial intelligence, the metaverse, synthetic
biology,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.240
our life in ten years from now will be completely
different

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:34.240
and who masters those technologies will be the
master of the world.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.240
Similar to his protege, Justin Trudeau, Klaus
Schwab makes a fascinating case study.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.240
Yet he too is merely the master of his own world,
Economic Forum.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:53.240
Science is replacing evolution by natural
selection with evolution by intelligent design.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.240
Not the intelligent design of some god above the
clouds,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.240
but our intelligent design and the intelligent
design of our clouds,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.240
the IBM cloud, the Microsoft cloud.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.240
These are the new driving forces of evolution.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.240
Today we have the technology to hack human beings
on a massive scale

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.240
and by this I mean that if you have enough data
and you have enough computing power,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.240
you can understand people better than they
understand themselves

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.240
and then you can manipulate them in ways which
were previously impossible.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:41.240
You know, the whole idea that humans have this
soul or spirit and they have free will, that's
over.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:47.240
Now how exactly will the future masters of the
planet look like?

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.240
This will be decided by the people who own the
data.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.240
Foreign powers can collect, store and exploit
biometric information from COVID tests.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.240
U.S. intelligence officials tell CBS News that
China is trying to collect Americans' DNA

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.240
in hopes of controlling the future of healthcare.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.240
China's test kits are a tool to help China compile
genetic data.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.240
The Chinese aren't the only ones exploring this
technology.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.240
The U.S. is working on it as well.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240
The White House is ramping up its COVID response,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.240
announcing Americans can once again get free COVID
test kits as concerns are growing over...

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.240
Data is the most important asset in the world.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:35.240
Those who control the data control the future, not
just of humanity, but the future of life itself.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.240
Everywhere she goes, Ouyang Haoyu is followed.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:46.240
What she buys, how she behaves is tracked and
scored to show how responsible and trustworthy she
is.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.240
It's called the social credit system.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.240
A person's reputation is scored on a scale of 350
to 950.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.240
Its big data meets Big Brother, expanding how the
government monitors, understands

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.240
and ultimately controls its 1.4 billion citizens.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.240
A good score brings benefits, but people with low
scores lose rights.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.240
The cinema names and shames people considered
untrustworthy,

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.240
plastering their details, even their addresses,
across big screens.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.240
And information collectors are paid to report on
their neighbors.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.240
The Supreme Court has created a blacklist for
so-called bad citizens.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.240
Among them is this journalist who got a little too
close to uncovering corruption

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240
among high-profile party members.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.240
He was blacklisted.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.240
He only realized when he tried to buy a train
ticket.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.240
Once you're blacklisted, you can no longer get a
bank loan,

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.240
start a business, buy an apartment, or even send
your children to a private school.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:49.240
By using the mechanism of social credit, we'll be
able to establish a blacklist of people.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.240
These punishments will serve as a whip to rebuild
moral values.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.240
And few here are willing to criticize it,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:02.240
something that may pose a risk itself for a bad
score and the life that comes with it.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.240
It may seem scary, but it's just like that here.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.240
We're used to it, and anyway we don't have a
choice.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.240
China wants obedient citizens.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.240
Criticism or resistance among the population is
virtually non-existent.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.240
This woman's door was kicked in by police when she
refused to go to quarantine.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.240
Now these videos show rows of metal containers
which are being used to house COVID-19 patients.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.240
Some of them have complained that very little food
is left for them in the freezing metal boxes.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:41.240
Chinese government officials now installing fences
in Shanghai, blocking people from leaving their
homes.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.240
For some, Shanghai feels like the world's largest
prison.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.240
We don't have enough food.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.240
All of a sudden, everyone is starving.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:02.240
How does a handful of autocrats gain total control
over a population of 1.4 billion?

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.240
I have two master degrees, one in clinical
psychology, one in statistics.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.240
And at the beginning of the crisis, I started to
study the statistics a little bit.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:20.240
The initial mathematical models and the initial
statistics all had dramatically overrated the
dangerousness of the virus.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:29.240
That was the moment when I started to think how it
was possible that an entire society and an entire
population

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:35.240
was in the grip of a narrative which in many
respects was blatantly wrong.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:43.240
After a few months, it became clear to me that the
only mechanism that could explain what was
happening in society

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.240
was what is usually referred to as mass formation.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.240
Mass formation is identical to hypnosis.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.240
And this term refers to a specific kind of group
formation

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.240
which has very special characteristic effects at
the level of individual mental functioning.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.240
And one of these effects is that an individual
that is in the grip of mass formation

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:19.240
typically lose every capacity to take a critical
distance from what they believe in, from what the
group believes in.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.240
You would think it would be people with lower IQs
that would be more susceptible to this,

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.240
but it seems to be the other way around. Are you
seeing this?

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:33.240
I have seen this, and it does seem to be predicted
by educational status and IQ.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.240
We look to be verified for our belief system,
right?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.240
And so a doctor goes to the CDC, and the CDC says
this is true, it must be true, I'm staying in that
zone.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.240
It's actually people outside of the system go,
well, I want to challenge the CDC here for a
second.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.240
Where's this study come from? Where's it, you
know, and that's what I do.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.240
All of these people were kept out of the
conversation.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.240
And you were wanting me to sign on to a social
contract where the scientific method isn't being
used.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.240
I'm not interested in medical pedigree. I'm
interested in medical consensus.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.240
People who are highly intelligent tend to go and
get a lot of degrees.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.240
Those people have spent so many years in
institutions to get those degrees

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.240
that they have developed a trust and confidence in
not only the educational institutions,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.240
but those that support them, which are largely
government bodies.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:24.240
And so they start from the place of if it's told
by the university, by the government, it's
probably going to be true.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:30.240
What I've learned about science is that it's
really imagined, they're looking at like a
fragment of the world,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.240
and it's all they see. It's all they're looking
at. The world, they don't see the world.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.240
So I think that there's a disconnect between
people who are smart and have lots of degrees

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.240
with actual reality, with the lived experience of
nature, of life,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.240
that you don't see with people who are actually
working with their hands outdoors all of the time.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.240
A mass formation typically emerges in a society
when very specific conditions are met.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.240
First and for all, the most central condition is a
major part of the population needs to feel lonely.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:09.240
Doctors say the very rules to keep people safe
from the virus are doing great damage when it
comes to anxiety,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.240
depression, and even suicide. And now everyone is
suffering, but children are particularly.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.240
The real pandemic here is the psychological
warfare that's being waged on every single human
being.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:29.240
See, if you take a human being and you put them in
a chronic physical condition,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.240
if you take a human being and you put them in a
chronic fear state,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.240
and you couple that with human isolation, what
happens is they psychologically decompensate

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.240
and live in such emotional pain that they will
gravitate in an irrational way

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.240
to anything that you promise them will alleviate
that pain.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.240
Once people feel disconnected from their
environment,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.240
they will typically start to experience a lack of
meaning-making in life.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.240
These conditions, if a narrative is distributed
through the mass media,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:08.240
indicating an object of anxiety and a strategy to
deal with this object of anxiety,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.240
they suddenly connect to one small object of fear,
for instance the coronavirus,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:20.240
and afterwards people don't feel lonely anymore.
They feel connected again.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.240
Let me hear you if you've had the Pfizer vaccine!

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.240
Let me hear you for Moderna!

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.240
Let me hear you for AstraZeneca!

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.240
Let me hear you for the anti-vaxxers!

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240
The new kind of social bond is highly problematic,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.240
just because the connections between the
individuals even deteriorate more,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.240
and the bond between the individual and the
collective becomes stronger and stronger and
stronger,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.240
which makes them willing to sacrifice everything
for the collective.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.240
Its health, its wealth, the future of its
children, everything.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.240
Something else that is really characteristic of
individuals in mass formation

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.240
is that they become radically intolerant for
dissonant voices.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.240
The people who are not getting vaccines, it's time
to start shaming them, or leave them behind.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.240
Vaccinated person having a heart attack? Yes, come
right on in, we'll take care of you.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.240
Unvaccinated guy, rest in peace Weezy.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.240
Put your mask on! Put your mask on, that's all you
gotta do!

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.240
We have to stop coddling the morons who will not
get the shot.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.240
Put it on, does it bother anybody else that she
doesn't have to wear a mask that we all do?

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.240
When are we going to stop putting up with the
idiots in this country?

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.240
You're a schmuck for not wearing a mask.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.240
And just say it's mandatory to get vaccinated.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.240
Screw your freedom.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.240
People who do not go along with the masses are
stigmatized,

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:53.240
and in the end, the masses are inclined to destroy
the people who do not go along with them.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.240
And they do so as if it is an ethical duty to do
so.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:06.240
Getting good people to do bad things, harmful
things, while thinking they're good things,

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.240
it's a dangerous place to be because it looks
great.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.240
You feel great while you're being used.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.240
They will sacrifice themselves, and they see it as
a virtue,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.240
because it demonstrates their complete obedience
to the cult, to the group,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.240
to perform ritualistic behavior which causes them
harm.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:35.240
One of the most clear illustrations of this was
when the leaders of the Communist Party in the
Soviet Union

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.240
were sentenced to death, often tortured to death,
they did not object.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.240
Things like, if this helps the Communist Party,
it's my pleasure to do it.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:51.240
That's something that was observed in all major
examples of mass formation in history.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:07.240
I was born in Communist China two years before Mao
started his Cultural Revolution.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.240
So we had to be indoctrinated, and chanting
slogans,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.240
and holding Chu Mai Mao's little red books to say
long live Chu Mai Mao, long live Communist Party.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.240
Inspired by Soviet Union dictators, Vladimir Lenin
and Joseph Stalin,

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.240
China's Communist leader, Mao Zedong, borrowed
from the playbook of the Russian Revolution.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.240
Lenin! Lenin! Lenin!

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:42.240
To fight anti-Communist forces, Lenin organized a
military branch of his Communist Party, known as
the Red Army.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.240
Following suit, Mao branded his army the Red
Guards.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.240
However, Mao's soldiers were not enlisted from his
military.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.240
His Red Guards were made up of high school and
university students.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.240
So he used young people to start Cultural
Revolution, to top down statues,

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:08.240
burning old buildings, and demonize all religions,
going after all dissident voices,

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.240
and to turn all the Chinese against each other.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.240
Family turned on each other. Neighbors turned on
each other.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:22.240
Chairman Mao, as he was known, was deeply
influenced by Lenin's ideas on Marxism and
revolution,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.240
and often praised Stalin as a great leader.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:32.240
He started his Great Leap Forward campaign in the
50s and killed 2 million landlord owners.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.240
40 million to 60 million people estimated starving
to death.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.240
The people were trading their children's dead
bodies to eat, to survive.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.240
Campbellism was everywhere.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:53.240
Through war, torture, execution, and famine,
Chairman Mao caused the death of 80 million
innocent people,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.240
making him the deadliest dictator of all time.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.240
China shaved the heads of women, put them all in
unattractive, asexual clothes,

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.240
did the same thing for the men.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.240
This technique has been used in the 20th century
by every totalitarian regime.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.240
Mao wanted to create a genderless society.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.240
That's why girls like me could not wear beautiful
clothes and could not do makeup.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.240
We have to just look like boys, unisex, no gender.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.240
They asexualized the population so that there's no
more desire,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.240
no more bipolarity of male and female.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.240
Everybody looks like an automaton.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.240
And then what do they do? Rather than turning
towards one another, they turn towards the state.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:38.240
So the only thing left for me, a child to believe
in, is communism.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:45.240
And Mao was the new god.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.240
Now in China, the government is not only cracking
down on Muslims,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.240
but on other religions as well, as it pushes to
assert communist ideology.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.240
Here's something else that is bad in China.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.240
Falun Gong, a religious movement that emphasizes
on spiritual enlightenment and cultivation of
virtue.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:32.240
5,000-year-old Chinese civilization were founded
on faith.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.240
Communist regime is atheist.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:43.240
So any philosophies which encourage people to
believe God, believe good things,

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.240
it's something they don't like.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:54.240
I decided to escape China after serious
persecution I have experienced.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.240
Under this pretext of COVID-19 coronavirus,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.240
the Chinese Communist Party has intensified its
persecution.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:13.240
We were arrested several times and detained in
various detention and brainwashing centers.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:19.240
Over the past few years, a vast network of camps
has been built across Xinjiang.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.240
A series of classified bulletins show how easy it
is to be singled out by the Chinese government for
education and training.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.240
The U.S. Defense Department says as many as 3
million are being forcibly detained

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.240
in re-education and forced labor camps.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.240
China calls them thought transformation camps
built to prevent extremism from spreading,

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.240
but reports indicate they're more like prisons.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.240
When I was detained in a detention center,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:53.240
I was handcuffed and hung over a radiator pipe
with my toes barely touching the ground.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:59.240
And I was hung over there for three days.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:08.240
The CCP guards brought four male detainees into my
cell

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.240
and began one of the worst experiences of torture.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:23.240
And on the brink of death, I realized I could do
nothing but turn to my belief.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.240
So I prayed to be saved.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:39.240
Moments later, one of the four male detainees
suddenly fainted on the floor,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.240
which interrupted the torture.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:51.240
I left China because my parents were heavily
persecuted for their practice of Falun Gong.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:57.240
From age one to age five, my grandparents were
taking care of me

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:04.240
because my parents, they were always incised like
this.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:12.240
My grandparents were taking care of me because my
parents, they were always incised,

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.240
some dark cells being tortured.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.240
My first clear memory of my mother,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:25.240
I was brought to a brainwashing center and saw her
being tied up to a chair

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.240
with like people behind her guarding her.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:34.240
And she had a very thick plastic tube inserted
into her nose

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.240
and she was being force-fed at the time.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.240
She just looked like she was in so much pain.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.240
And I was five at the time.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:49.240
That was, it's just very traumatizing.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.240
My school principal actually came to me several
times and told me

00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:02.240
not to be a part of my parents and to report any
activity that my parents would do.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.240
They're instilling all the lies and hatred into
the younger generation.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:14.240
The young people are used today to do the American
cultural revolution.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.240
The young people are used today to do the American
cultural revolution

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.240
to turn the kids basically not to trust their
parents anymore

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.240
and say, oh, my parents don't understand me, I'm
confused,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.240
I need to turn to my teachers, turn to other
authority figures,

00:43:33.240 --> 00:44:00.240
look at the American cultural revolution to see
how many similarities are there.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.240
Communism will win.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.240
That's not a joke.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.240
That will happen.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.240
You were happy with what was happening in the
USSR.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240
No, we're not.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240
We make a critique of it.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.240
That's why we're Maoists.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.240
We make a critique of it in order to improve
socialism

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:23.240
the next time it comes around and throws people
like your ass into a labor camp.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.240
Yesterday I asked ChatGPT,

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.240
are there any similarities between today's woke
revolution

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.240
and Chairman Mao's cultural revolution of the
1960s?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:37.240
And it wrote back, how long do you have?

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:42.240
We recognize that government is absolutely
necessary for an orderly society.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:49.240
But following the dictum that government like fire
is both beneficial and dangerous,

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.240
we believe in the concept of limited government.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.240
And we believe that the constitutional republic
created by our founding fathers

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.240
is the best form of limited government that has
yet been devised by man.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.240
A republic is a limited democracy.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:12.240
It's a form of government based upon the principle
of limited majority rule.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.240
Limited so that the minority, even a minority of
one,

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.240
can be protected against the whims and passions of
the majority.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.240
Now, democracy is a form of government based upon
the principle of majority rule.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.240
It's easy to understand, easy to sell to the
masses, and I might add, deadly.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.240
The fathers of philosophy, Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle,

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.240
were all staunch critics of democracy.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.240
History's greatest minds all observed that even a
well-intended democracy

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.240
can breed deception, division, and ultimately
total control by the state.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.240
Aristotle wrote that democracy is not just the
rule of the majority.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.240
Democracy is a system in which the majority is in
charge,

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.240
respecting the basic elementary rights and
principles of minorities.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.240
If not, democracy becomes a tyranny of the
majority.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.240
Socrates himself became a victim of this very
process.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.240
He was sentenced to death by a majority vote

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.240
for protesting the rights and protections of the
minority.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.240
This country was founded on the principle that

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.240
the individual is sovereign over the institution
of government,

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.240
and it's about a philosophy of governance that
says that you are a free individual,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.240
or a philosophy of governance that says you're
served and you're subject.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.240
We have inalienable rights just by virtue of being
human,

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.240
and so their primary responsibility as the
government is to protect those rights.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.240
These aren't rules to govern me, they're rules to
govern the government,

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.240
like what, you know, what you are and are not
allowed to do to me.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.240
We are a constitutional republic with a
representative democracy,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.240
so people do vote, but we have a separation of
powers.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.240
So if you majority vote to eat you for lunch,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240
the Supreme Court can say, no, you cannot.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.240
And how do you protect the minority from the
majority?

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.240
You write down a set of rules on a piece of paper.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.240
You say, this we can do, that we cannot.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.240
At the top of the paper, you write the word
constitution.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.240
And then everyone agrees to follow the rules no
matter what the temptation.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:29.240
And when you're finished, you've created a
constitutional republic.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.240
It was Thomas Jefferson who said,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.240
The republic is the only form of government

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:41.240
which is not eternally at open or secret war with
the rights of mankind.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:47.240
Now we hear a lot of talk today about
right-wingers, left-wingers, extremists, and
moderates.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.240
The political spectrum concept, if it has any
meaning at all,

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.240
is a measurement scale showing all the variations
in government.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:02.240
Now, the extremists at the zero end would be those
who advocate no government at all, the anarchists.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.240
The extremists at the other end would be those who
advocate total government.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.240
And who are they? Well, the communists, of course.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.240
But also the Nazis, the fascists.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:18.240
No matter what they may call themselves, if they
advocate total government control over the people,

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:25.240
they are all, by definition, totalitarians.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.240
The debate is not between conservatives and
liberals.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.240
It goes back in history long before those words
were ever invented.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:42.240
The opposing points of view properly are
identified as individualism versus collectivism.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.240
The individualist believes that the rights of the
individual

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:50.240
must not be obliterated by the desires of the
collective or the group.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.240
The collectivist, on the other hand, believes that
the group is more important than the single person
within it,

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:03.240
and that the individual must be sacrificed, if
necessary, for the greater good of the greater
number.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.240
The individualists believe that every man has a
personal and direct responsibility

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.240
to provide first for himself, next for his family,

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.240
and then for those outside his family who may be
in need.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:21.240
The collectivist, on the other hand, declares that
the individual is not personally responsible for
charity,

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:26.240
raising his own children, providing for his aging
parents, or even providing for himself, for that
matter.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:32.240
This is a group function of the state, of
government itself.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:40.240
Everything we talk about socialism, communism,
globalism, and Nazism, guess what?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.240
It's all collective society.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.240
Collectivism on an international level is
essentially known as globalism,

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.240
which is often promoted as a framework for unity
and sustainability.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.240
Under the guise of philanthropy, the leaders of
the globalist movement leverage every possible
crisis

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:02.240
to advance their plan to replace national
sovereignty with a one-world government.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:09.240
We are confronted with so many crises
simultaneously.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.240
What does it need to master the future?

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.240
It is the globalists who are behind the
destructive new methods of control, like ESG,

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.240
the acronym for Environmental Social Governance.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.240
Similar to China's social credit score, ESG is a
ranking system

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:33.240
that tracks a company or country's carbon
footprint as well as its commitment to diversity
and inclusion.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:37.240
A low ESG score can lead to severe consequences,

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:45.240
including reputational damage, legal and
regulatory actions, and loss of investors and bank
credit lines.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:53.240
Within the last decade, numerous nations and
thousands of major brands have been coerced to
adapt to the ESG program,

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.240
and today, many of them are paying the price.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:03.240
In 2018, the World Economic Forum published an
article on its website entitled

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:08.240
How We Will Make Sri Lanka Rich by 2025.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.240
That article was removed once it became known that
food prices in Sri Lanka had nearly doubled

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:18.240
and that millions of their citizens were facing
starvation.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.240
Now what caused this? Farmers protested and asked
the government to work with them

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.240
on slowly improving farming practices to be more
environmentally friendly

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.240
rather than implementing harsh bans.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.240
But the government was more interested in
maintaining a high ESG score with its creditors
like BlackRock.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:40.240
As a result, food production dropped drastically,
with farmers expecting crop losses of 85%.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:46.240
The country had to begin spending money on
importing food when it was previously
self-sufficient.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.240
Sri Lanka is a cautionary tale.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.240
What's happening there could be a foreshadowing of
what's in store for us

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.240
if we don't take heed and learn some lessons.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:59.240
The Dutch government was one of the first to sign
on to the ESG system.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:04.240
Dutch farmers pleaded that the rush to adapt to
extreme new regulations

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.240
would result in the destruction of the country's
food supply.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.240
The Netherlands is the second largest agriculture
exporter in the world,

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.240
earning the title of the tiny country that feeds
the world.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.240
A collapse of their system could trigger a global
food crisis.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:25.240
Yet, the Netherlands' prime minister continued to
persecute Dutch farmers until they were forced to
revolt.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.240
Where do you find still such a prime minister in
the world?

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:37.240
You find it in the Netherlands, and it's Mark
Rutte.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.240
And remember too, the Netherlands is the pilot
program of the World Food Hubs

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.240
and the World Economic Forum has assigned to the
Netherlands

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.240
what they call this global secretariat.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.240
I'm using ironically a communist term for it.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.240
Klaus Schwab's golden pin-up boy, Prime Minister
Mark Rutte,

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.240
is busy fulfilling the agenda of the World
Economic Forum's Great Reset

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.240
by turfing farmers off their own land.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:11.240
Perhaps the most important lesson I've learned in
my years as prime minister

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.240
of one of the world's most outward-looking trading
countries

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:24.240
is that national interests are often best served
by international cooperation.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.240
Schwab has sold this idea because they're up
against the wall.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.240
Okay, you have all these governments that are
basically broke.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:37.240
So what will happen is if they defaulted, then all
the people have lost their pensions,

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.240
they've counted on it, and they're going to be
storming their palaces with pitchforks.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:47.240
Schwab has sold the idea that, well, we go towards
Marxism and you can still retain power.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:53.240
None of these net-zero climate schemes work
without massively disrupting

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.240
or even destroying the lives of the little people.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.240
If you think about what created wealthy people
wealthy throughout the many years

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.240
of our human history, it was the ownership of
land.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.240
And you have governments right now that are
looking to take ownership of real estate,

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.240
and it's happening everywhere.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.240
And you have this movement of individuals kind of
going like,

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.240
hey, people should never profit off of real
estate.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:19.240
And unfortunately, that ideology is what the
government is using to take control.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.240
If we look at data from 2001 to 2015, there is a
slow and steady trend towards

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.240
more corporations owning single-family homes,
apartments, office spaces,

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.240
and less and less individuals actually owning real
estate.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.240
Blackstone Group actually recently raised a record
of $50 billion

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.240
to take homes from American families.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.240
During the pandemic, when all people were ordered
to lock down indoors,

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.240
why did governments around the world make
exceptions for mass protests?

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.240
We've all heard the term fire sale. In this case,
it's not a metaphor.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:58.240
When a community is damaged by protests, the value
of local properties plummet.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.240
Investors then gobble up the devalued real estate
for pennies on the dollar.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.240
In many cases, the leaders of the decimated
communities receive kickbacks

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.240
for allowing this transfer of wealth.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.240
Big companies and investment firms swooping in and
buying up

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.240
some of the only affordable homes in your
neighborhood.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.240
The more you have individuals not own their own
home,

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.240
the more you have individuals not financially
independent,

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.240
it creates more dependence on big financial
corporations

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.240
that profit off of mass people.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.240
We are going towards a world where the people are
owning nothing.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.240
I always say, like, if we don't own anything,
well, who does?

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.240
Bill Gates, business magnate, software developer,
philanthropist,

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.240
nation's largest farmland owner. Gates owns nearly
270,000 acres.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.240
It's a re-institution of Marxism where, you know,

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.240
communism owned all the property.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.240
In his Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx wrote,

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.240
the theory of communism may be summed up in a
single sentence,

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.240
abolition of private property.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.240
Karl Marx was a German philosopher and social
theorist

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.240
who lived in the 1800s.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.240
He is the co-author of the Communist Manifesto,

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.240
which has been referred to as the Bible of
Communism.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.240
His theories of class conflict and dialectical
materialism

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.240
were instrumental in shaping socialist and
communist movements worldwide.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:25.240
Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Mao
Zedong,

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.240
Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Kim Jong-un, Hugo
Chavez,

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.240
Nicolas Maduro, and many other communist
revolutionaries

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:38.240
have cited Marxism as the foundation of their
political ideologies.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.240
Marx rejected all concepts of God, as well as the
traditional family.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.240
According to members of his own family, Marx was
emotionally,

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.240
verbally, and physically abusive.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.240
His wife, Ginny, was plagued by depression,

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.240
which was compounded by Karl's adulterous impulses

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.240
and his inability to provide for his children.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.240
Despite his privileged upbringing and formal
education,

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.240
Karl Marx was often unwilling to work

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:13.240
and instead relied on the financial support of
friends and family.

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.240
In 1943, the following directive was issued from
party headquarters

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.240
to all communists in the United States.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.240
It read, when certain obstructionists become too
irritating,

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:30.240
label them as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-Semitic.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.240
In the public mind, constantly associate those who
oppose us

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.240
with those names which already have a bad smell.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.240
The association will, after enough repetition,

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.240
become fact in the public mind.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.240
The founding fathers were racist, misogynist,

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.240
fascist, fascist, fascist political party,

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.240
radicals on the far right, anti-Semitic,
anti-Semitic,

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.240
xenophobic, transphobic, Uncle Tom's, white
supremacists,

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.240
domestic terrorists, neo-Nazi organizers, Nazis.

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240
You are an anti-vaxxer.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240
An anti-vaxxer.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240
Racist.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.240
Racist.

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240
Racist.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240
A racist.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.240
Name-calling is their number one bullying tactic,

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.240
and they apply it unremittingly to anyone who
questions their dogma

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.240
or says something they find unacceptable or
offensive.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:22.240
As early as 1928, the communists declared that the
racial differences

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.240
among our people constituted the weakest and most
vulnerable point

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.240
in our social fabric.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.240
By constantly probing and straining at this one
spot,

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:35.240
they calculated that eventually the cloth could be
torn apart

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.240
and that Americans could be divided, weakened,

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.240
and perhaps even set against each other in open
combat.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.240
They said in no unmistakable terms that the Negro
people,

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.240
because of their social status and their
predominant working class composition,

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.240
offered greater revolutionary possibilities

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.240
than any other cross-section of the population.

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.240
How do we get out of this mess?

00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.240
Revolution, nothing less!

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.240
Revolution, nothing less!

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.240
Revolution, nothing less!

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.240
Revolution, nothing less!

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.240
Revolution, nothing less!

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.240
The communists call not only for extensive chaos
within the cities,

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.240
the plan is for raging fires from one city to the
next.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.240
The average American may say, soft and decadent,

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.240
when he sees billows of black smoke rising from
one horizon to the other,

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.240
when at night the only light he has to see by

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.240
flickering red from flames leaping into the sky,

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.240
he'll become paralyzed with fear and panic

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.240
and do nothing to interfere with the guerrilla
bands

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.240
as they strike at the community's power centers.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.240
To justify violence,

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.240
they have to be able to claim that they're
liberating people.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.240
And if people are to be liberated,

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.240
then it's necessary to go through the motions at
least

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.240
of pretending that they have a right to form a
nation of their own.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.240
The Communist Party called for their liberation,

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
to break away from the United States

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.240
and to set up their own nation within our borders.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.240
Activists now control a barricaded area.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240
It's been called an autonomous zone.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.240
They want it to be free of capitalism, state
authority, and police.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.240
To take the United States, all of the United
States,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:20.240
it'll be necessary, they say, to involve white
people as well as black

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.240
and, in general, to escalate their revolution in
America

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.240
from race war to class war.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.240
Feed the rich and feed the poor.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.240
This is class war.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240
Now, when they talk about pressure from above,

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.240
they mean using their people and their influence

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.240
within the very government marked for takeover

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.240
to bring forward official recommendations for
legislation.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.240
The recommendations, of course, are offered
supposedly

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.240
as solutions to national problems,

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.240
but when passed into law, their only real effect

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.240
is to vastly increase the power of government

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.240
and to move the country that much closer toward
the ultimate goal.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.240
The pressure from below, then, involves using
their influence

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.240
over the various mass membership organizations of
the country

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.240
to create the appearance of great popular support

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.240
for these recommendations.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.240
Of course, the members of those organizations must
never suspect

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.240
that they're being used to promote the communist
program.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.240
Now, the silent majority, the average person,

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.240
is caught right in the middle.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.240
He looks above and sees highly respected spokesmen
for government

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.240
calling for socialist legislation.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.240
He looks below and sees mobs of demonstrators

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.240
shouting for the same thing.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.240
He says to himself, has everyone gone crazy or is
it me?

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.240
Now, he's still in the majority, of course, but he
doesn't know it.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.240
He thinks he's helplessly outnumbered,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.240
and he bows to what he thinks is the democratic
will of the majority.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.240
Here's an interesting thing I've noticed,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.240
is even with a lot of these ideologies,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240
with what people call these days, you know, woke,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:03.240
if people were these horrible, awful, bigoted,
racist, xenophobic whites,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.240
it wouldn't even work.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.240
The only reason it even works is because people
are so compassionate

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.240
that they, oh, like, I want to make sure I use the
right words

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.240
and I say the right phrases.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.240
So you're actually weaponizing the fact that
people are decent people

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.240
and you're taking that compassion and you're
targeting it at,

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.240
oh, this is the group of people who you should be
angry at.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.240
They weaponized human compassion.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.240
We mustn't kid ourselves into thinking

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.240
that the communists have placed their agitators

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.240
only into the black communities.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240
They're working both sides of the street.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.240
They want hatred, violence, and bloodshed between
the races,

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240
and they don't care how they get it or whom they
use,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.240
even children if necessary.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.240
My young comrades.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.240
Hi!

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.240
This is my way of figuring out if you've been
tainted by the patriarchy.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240
Patriarchy?

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.240
Oh!

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240
This looks creepy.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240
It looks creepy.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240
It looks creepy.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240
Why?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240
There's just, like, this thing about white people

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240
that just makes me a villain.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.240
Oh, looks like Donnie got a full cookie.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.240
Because he's a white man.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240
Say it with me.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.240
Structural racism!

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.240
Yeah!

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.240
You may have wondered why the Communist Party

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.240
has been a staunch supporter of the drive

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.240
to place a black studies curriculum into our high
schools and colleges.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.240
The reason becomes obvious the minute you take a
look

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240
at the textbooks and the study guides.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.240
Schools are now radicalizing our kids.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.240
I mean, this is the volume of the book from
Critical Race Theory,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.240
and it literally says here,

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240
whiteness is a bad deal,

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.240
and it has a symbol of Satan.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240
You gonna deliberately teach kids,

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.240
this white kid right here got it better than you
because he white?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.240
You gonna purposely tell a white kid,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240
oh, the black people are all down to suppress.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.240
How do I have two medical degrees if I'm sitting
here oppressed?

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.240
Not only is it in the schools, but it's in the
workplace.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240
It's throughout society.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.240
It's destroying this country.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.240
If this continues, we will look back

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.240
and be responsible for the dismantling

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.240
of the greatest country in the world

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240
by reverting to teaching hate

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
and that race is a determining factor

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.240
on where your destiny lies.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240
Thank you.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240
Sarasota School Board Chairwoman,

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.240
what has been the worst of what you've had to deal
with

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.240
in terms of community or parental reaction?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.240
You know, the calling of names, you know,

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.240
tyrant, Marxist, communist,

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.240
and they want to move kids over to charter schools

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.240
and private schools without the oversight of the
state,

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240
and that's wrong.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240
Education authorities in the United States

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.240
are asking the government to use anti-terror laws

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.240
and involve the FBI against parents

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.240
who protest against the way their children are
being taught.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.240
It identifies no fewer than 13 possible federal
crimes,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.240
including making annoying phone calls.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.240
How about this one?

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240
They could be prosecuted for using the internet

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.240
in a way that might cause emotional distress.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.240
Over the weekend, Democrats voted

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.240
to ban gendered language in House rules,

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.240
and that means no more terms like father or
mother.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240
Is the administration's official policy

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.240
to replace the term woman with birthing people?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.240
Black birthing people.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.240
Black birthing people.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.240
Black and indigenous birthing people.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.240
You shifted from, in places,

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.240
from using the term mother to birthing people.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.240
Again, we're trying to be precise in the language
that's used.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240
Mom's a pretty good word.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.240
I'm not a birth person. I'm a mother.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:39.240
Can you provide a definition for the word woman?

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.240
Can I provide a definition?

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.240
No.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.240
Yeah.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.240
I can't.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.240
You can't?

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.240
Not in this context. I'm not a biologist.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240
So you believe the meaning of the word woman

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240
is so unclear and controversial

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.240
that you can't give me a definition?

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240
Do you believe, then, that men can become pregnant

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
and have abortions?

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.240
Yes.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.240
Literally everything that was fought for

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.240
for women's rights is going straight down the
drain.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.240
This environment that has been created

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.240
and corrupted and manipulated

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.240
does not respect women, does not respect children,

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.240
does not respect men.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.240
It cares nothing for family.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.240
So that's why they have to attack mother and
remove father,

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240
because she's going to protect that child,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.240
he's going to protect that woman,

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.240
and they both are going to protect society.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240
Good evening.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.240
Good evening.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240
Thank you very much.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.240
Thank you for your service.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.240
When you talk about a parent-child relationship,

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.240
you're talking about something primal.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:44.240
It is in the heart of the liberal, not the
Marxist,

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.240
that's in the heart of the person who's
conservative.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.240
And they're pushing the boundaries on something

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.240
that they cannot control.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.240
Washington state is on track to lawfully take

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.240
gender dysphoric children away from parents

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.240
who oppose transitioning treatment.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.240
That is against the Constitution.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.240
The only time a parent loses their rights

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.240
is if there's an extreme circumstance.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.240
It's severing the bond between the parent and the
child.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.240
What they're doing is they're dividing families

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240
to take control of the children.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.240
The biggest defense against communism is the
nuclear family.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.240
In Chapter 2 of his Communist Manifesto,

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.240
Karl Marx wrote,

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240
Abolition of the family.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.240
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of
course.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.240
We're here today to represent the millions of
black Americans

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.240
who disagree with the Black Lives Matter movement.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240
If you go to the Black Lives Matter website,

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240
it says that we disrupt the nuclear family.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.240
That's my wife. This is our four children.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.240
Why would you disrupt the nuclear family?

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.240
Because the real objective is to remove the family

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.240
as a possible alternate source of guidance and
support.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.240
All totalitarian regimes strive to destroy the
close-knit family

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.240
in order to remove any loyalties

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.240
that might be higher than to the state itself.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.240
I have seen over the years in my practice

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.240
a steady decline in the expression of healthy
masculinity

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240
and healthy femininity.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240
The separation between the male and the female

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.240
is almost complete now,

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.240
and it's due specifically to the ongoing attacks

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.240
against masculinity and the degradation of
femininity.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.240
And if our family structure is lost in the next
generation,

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.240
what do we have left?

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.240
We're just a bunch of listless individuals

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240
living our lives out virtually behind a computer
screen

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240
and following the orders of the government.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.240
Maybe it's because I came in the movement at 17
1⁄2,

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.240
so I have, like, just a knack

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.240
for knowing how to organize young people.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.240
I was at our publications table today,

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.240
and I was speaking to this young person,

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.240
and he grabbed a book, and he said,

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.240
it's like Mal's Red Book.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.240
And I was like, man, that's what I was thinking.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.240
And it was just really cool to hear him make that
connection.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.240
I was like, how about you buy, like, 10 to 15 of
these books,

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.240
and you all have, like, a youth organizing group

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.240
where you talk about it, and you really try to
engage this.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.240
We need to build off of this.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.240
We actually do have an ideological frame.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.240
Myself and Alicia in particular, we are trained
Marxists.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240
I do believe in Marxism.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.240
It's a philosophy that I learned really early on

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.240
in my organizing career.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240
Investigations into the Black Lives Matter
organization

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.240
has revealed links to groups that are
pro-communist China.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.240
The self-proclaimed Marxist Black Lives Matter
co-founder,

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.240
Alicia Garza, also owns the Black Futures Lab
project.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.240
Yet all would be lost for the Black Future Lab

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.240
if not for the Chinese Progressive Association.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240
Donations to the Black Futures Lab

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.240
don't go directly to the foundation itself.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.240
The Chinese Progressive Association gets them
instead.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.240
Through forensic investigations,

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.240
we now know that the 2020 BLM,

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.240
fiery but mostly peaceful protests,

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.240
were organized and partially funded

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.240
through a network of pro-communist organizations.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.240
One of the groups is U.S.-based Liberation Road,

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.240
which was founded by a faction of the Communist
Party of Vietnam.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.240
Liberation Road is allied with the New Communist
Movement

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.240
and has direct ties to the Chinese Communist
Party.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.240
The San Francisco-based, communist-rooted

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.240
Chinese Progressive Association

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.240
formed a sister company called Asians for Black
Lives

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.240
to serve as a bridge between BLM and the Chinese
Communist Party.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.240
I spent a lot of time with President Xi.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.240
He's deadly earnest

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.240
about becoming the most significant,

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:53.240
most consequential nation in the world.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240
When we speak of China,

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.240
it's important to distinguish between the people

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.240
and their oppressive government.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.240
And while the Communist Party of China

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.240
is undoubtedly America's greatest foreign
adversary,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.240
it's crucial to recognize that the most urgent
threat

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240
to the future of the United States

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.240
resides within its own borders.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.240
We're so used to thinking in terms of

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240
the old-fashioned concepts of warfare,

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.240
we fail to realize that the favorite weapons

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.240
of communist conquest are instead propaganda.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240
Do you know who the greatest propagator of
disinformation

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240
in the history of the world is?

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240
The U.S. government.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.240
The slanted view of history.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.240
History has been written to tell us a certain
story.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.240
The 1619 Project is trying to reframe that story.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.240
What these people are doing is subverting young
black minds

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.240
to think that the Revolutionary War was fought

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.240
in order to preserve slavery.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240
And it's based on something that simply isn't
true.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.240
The tactics of internal subversion.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.240
I thought that America was racist.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.240
I thought it was patriarchal.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.240
I thought our capitalist society

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.240
was just a means of exploiting people.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.240
And I thought all these things

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.240
because that is what I was told.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.240
The preaching of hatred to incite civil disorder.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240
I want to tell you, Kavanaugh,

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.240
you have released the whirlwind

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.240
and you will pay the price.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.240
A California man is facing federal charges

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.240
for the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice
Brett Kavanaugh.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.240
Treason, blackmail, the smear.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240
This is the first time Assange is being questioned

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240
over the rape allegations.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.240
The LA Times ran an article

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.240
calling Larry Elder a black white supremacist.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.240
All committed by soldiers who wear no uniform

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240
and who claim to be loyal citizens

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.240
of the target country marked for conquest from
within.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.240
World War III that rages around us right now

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.240
is a political war, an economic war,

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.240
a psychological war, a spiritual war.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240
As a matter of fact,

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.240
the bomb as a psychological weapon

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.240
is being dropped on the American people

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.240
every single day.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.240
You probably assume you're safe.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.240
That could be a deadly mistake.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240
Bracing for food shortages.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240
Labor shortages.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240
Shipping delays.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240
Supply chain disruptions.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.240
A new coronavirus variant.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240
Rushed virus variant.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.240
Ultra transmissible.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.240
It can kill you.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240
It can kill you.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240
A surging crime.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240
Surging crime.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240
Acts of terrorism.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240
Domestic terrorism.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240
White terrorism.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240
White supremacy.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.240
Mass shootings.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240
Mass shootings.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.240
And nuclear conflict.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.240
Nuclear conflict.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240
World War III.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240
World War III.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240
Vladimir Putin.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.240
Russia.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.240
Russia.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.240
Environmental doom.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.240
Fire, storms.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.240
And deadly floods.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240
I don't want you to be hopeful.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240
Science tells us we have nine years.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240
This storm will kill you.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240
I want you to panic.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240
It is promoting fear.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240
It will kill your children.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240
Feelings of fear.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240
It will kill your pets.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.240
The world is a very terrifying place.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.240
Unless you get lucky.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:48.240
I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.000
Walk me through, if you would, what happens
scientifically inside our minds when we're

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.760
in a state of fear, and then how that affects our
external choices and the direction of

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.960
our lives.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.960
This is well-known and well-researched in the
psychological literature and the psychiatric

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.920
literature, that when someone is afraid, when
someone is in a state of fear, that person

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.160
cannot think rationally.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:16.400
You resort back to a more primitive way of making
decisions, which is highly emotionally

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.480
driven.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.120
And when you're placed in a chronic state of fear,
as we have been, you end up in a

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.720
what I would call a traumatized state, meaning
that you're not just momentarily scared.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.340
You are frozen.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:32.000
You have seen your ability to think critically
suspended.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.300
The issue is not about COVID or vaccines or
anything else.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.760
It's not that.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:44.800
That is the polarizing impulse that gives rise to
our general sensibilities, which then

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.240
amplifies our willingness to fall for reflexive
classifications like race or, you know, the

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.200
isms that we want to fight about.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:58.080
The more we can distract people by creating the
illusion that says everything is fearful,

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.440
the more we can manipulate the population.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.280
We were groomed for decades to be fearful, whether
it was drop and cover.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.120
We must be ready all the time if the atomic bomb
explodes.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.080
Duck and cover.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.560
To protect against the threat of nuclear
annihilation, or more recently, the impending
ecological

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.160
collapse of our planet in 12 years that AOC and
Greta Thunberg keep warning us about.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.480
The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't
address climate change.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.600
How dare you?

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.440
All of these fears are grounded to some degree in
reality.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:38.240
They're not completely invented, but they are
exaggerated so greatly that we cannot

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.520
actually reason through them anymore.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.520
When people are afraid, they won't just accept
authoritarianism, they'll demand it.

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.600
They will demand it.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.120
Somebody do something.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.000
Somebody take charge and tell me what to do.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.240
Like where do I stand?

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
Where do I walk?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240
What do we do?

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240
What are the rules?

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.720
And again, people in power always use that, right?

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.960
They say never let a good crisis go to waste.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.880
We can take this and we can now enact policies
that normally we wouldn't be able to get away

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880
with.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.480
Maybe in a couple of decades, when people look
back, the thing they will remember from

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.820
the COVID crisis, this was the moment that we
agreed to be surveyed all the time.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:19.960
And maybe even after the event is over, maybe we
can still keep 30%.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.460
And over time, multiple crises, oh, suddenly you
have a government or an individual who

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:29.120
has far more power than they're actually supposed
to.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.240
The leaders of the mass, the people who pronounce
a narrative in public space usually are hypnotized

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.240
themselves.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.200
They believe they need to reshape society to be
able to deal with the challenges society

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.480
faces.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.640
And they believe so fanatically in that ideology
that they think it's justified to manipulate

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.560
and cheat and to use all kinds of narratives to
convince people to go along with that ideology.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560
We're going to go visit mom.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.400
I'm going to bring the whole family to see mom.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.480
No, we will shut you down.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.920
We will cite you.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.760
And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will
take you to jail.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.480
You either get your tests done and make sure
you're cleared or we will keep you in a facility

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480
longer.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.400
It's going to be very hard for people to do a lot
of normal life unless they can prove

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.360
their vaccination status, such as you're not going
to work in this particular agency or

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.200
institution, you're not going to be able to go to
this college or this university.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:34.080
Once we start doing that, you will see more and
more people willingly get vaccinated.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.440
If the fear of losing your job, your friends,
family, and future isn't enough to coerce

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.120
you into submission, perhaps these incentives will
entice you to willingly comply.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.960
Everything from cash prizes to college
scholarships, offering kids 12 and up limited
edition Avengers

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.120
comic books, thousands of prizes available,
including cruises and Superbowl tickets, giving

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.880
away Ford F-150 trucks, giving away shotguns and
hunting rifles, marijuana dispensaries

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.280
are given away, joints for Jack, Krispy Kreme
announcing this week a free donut and yes,

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280
free beers.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280
That's right.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Get a shot and have a beer.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.960
Today could be your lucky day.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:18.680
California's vaccine lottery, one grand winner to
take home up to $5 million if you get vaccinated

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.680
next week.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.040
You made it exciting, right?

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.240
There's a reason people go to Vegas.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.400
It really could be somewhat lucrative if they
aren't already persuaded.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.960
Teen-year-old Joshua says one of the best parts of
getting a shot at Mickey D's, lunch

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960
on the house.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:39.480
Just think of this when you think of vaccination,
vaccination.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.240
If you need luck with love, dating apps are
offering incentives too.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:49.320
Vienna brothel is providing COVID-19 vaccinations
and giving those who take up the offer a 30

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.000
minute session with a quote, lady of their choice.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.480
We have finally found the one thing that makes us
all more attractive, a vaccination.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.200
To love one another, as Jesus said, get
vaccinated, get boosted.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:07.800
Do you think that it's being posed as politics,
but it's behaving like a religion?

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.080
Because it's acting like a religion.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080
Yeah.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.560
It's dogmatic, it's absolute.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.400
It's if you do not believe in it, you are
condemned to hell.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.080
This is a new religion.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.000
God did answer our prayers.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.040
He made the smartest men and women, the
scientists, the doctors, the researchers.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.640
He made them come up with a vaccine.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:57.720
That is from God to us, and we must say, thank
you, God, thank you.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:14.800
There was a time, and not too long ago, I think,
when we could have pulled ourselves

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.680
out of this without too great a sacrifice on the
part of anyone.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.320
But we didn't.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:24.240
Instead, we slept.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.520
Everywhere I look, I see men and women who know
that communists are making headway in

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.120
this country.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.880
They know that something must be done and that
someone must stand up to them, but they

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.760
themselves do nothing.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:46.000
They remain silent because they're afraid that if
they speak out, it'll be bad for business.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.520
They may lose a client.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.840
They may even lose their jobs, or perhaps they're
receiving a regular government check

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.520
and already are too dependent upon some of the
very people and programs they know they

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.080
should oppose.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.480
We have now passed the point of painless solutions
and parlor patriotism.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:10.120
Well, all right, so what do we do about it?

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:15.280
What are the countermeasures that need to be
taken, and where do we begin?

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.840
Before we finally win this battle, and I should
hasten to say that there's no doubt in my

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.680
mind that we're going to win.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:28.480
I'm increasingly convinced of this, but before we
finally do see victory, we must carry the

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.800
truth to every man, woman, and child in America.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:42.560
I have no idea of what each of you is going to do
in the critical days that lie ahead.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.280
It may be much.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.440
It may be little.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.480
It may be nothing at all.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.480
I don't know.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:55.040
Only you can answer that question, but ladies and
gentlemen, whatever it is you decide to

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.360
do for your country, do it soon.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.440
Do it now.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:13.040
Every minute that you delay further will add
dearly to the price of ultimate victory.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.600
Mr. Griffin, that was over 50 years ago.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600
Where are we now?

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:22.680
Hearing that phrase after all these years is kind
of a shocker, because I didn't realize

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.400
really at the time how accurate it was going to
be.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.200
But we're in the middle of it now, and so the
ultimate victory is still ahead of us.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.520
How did you know way back then what would be
happening today?

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.120
It's a long story, of course, but I did take a
fascinating tour of the communist bookstore

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.520
in Los Angeles when I was very, very young.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.560
I was working for an insurance company.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.240
I was Mr. Corporate America, you know?

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.960
That was the period when the hippie, you know,
image was pretty popular, and a lot of these

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.360
guys in that bookstore were in that uniform, and I
think they felt I was a potential recruit,

01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360
you know?

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360
Yes, we've always been quite willing to talk
about...

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360
We'll talk about socialism anywhere, in the
streets or in the senate, anywhere, you know?

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360
You're a communist faction making a big power play
for SDS.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360
Is there any communists back here?

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360
I guess there is.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:21.080
Yes, they are communists, and yet our nation seems
unconcerned.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.720
Many newspapers, television commentators, and
educators call these young revolutionaries

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.660
dissidents.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:34.760
But are these voices, voices of mere dissent, of
mere student unrest, or of sedition and

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.760
revolution?

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.200
They invited me to come to their study groups,
they called them.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.320
They were really the recruiting funnel, you know?

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.040
And I didn't have to pretend to be interested,
because I was interested.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.280
I wanted to see what these guys were up to.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:55.140
In the course, the more I read, the more I
realized that these guys were deadly serious,

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:59.520
and so my crusader gene said, hey buddy, you
better stop worrying about the corporate ladder

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.580
and making money and looking good and start doing
something about it.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:09.640
And I'm glad I did, because up to that point, my
life had a meaning, it had a purpose more

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.640
than just self-centered.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.400
Who are some of the key figures behind this
agenda?

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.300
I'm not sure we can name names.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:22.200
We know that there are layers and layers of
control and influence, sort of pyramidal in

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.320
form.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.040
At the bottom level, of course, is just all the
common people.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.440
Most of them don't even know what's going on.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:35.160
It used to be that an invader could come in with a
superior army, and people resented,

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.360
but they obeyed, because if they don't, they get
killed.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.200
Now, if they want to conquer people in this
environment, they have to do it through the

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200
mind.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.720
And of course, today, after all the technology
that we have, and the control over the
communications

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.840
and the images and the school system and the
media, they have absolute control over the

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.440
funnel of information that comes to the average
person.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.680
And the average person, if they're not aware that
there's a real war going on for their

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.840
mind, they will be helpless.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.040
And as long as people are on the edge of fear,
they're willing to give up their liberties

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.240
and pay lots and lots in taxes.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.320
A tax on carbon.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:21.360
And as I pass through that idea that, in my view,
the enemy is in a category called collectivism,

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.160
and that's the word that applies to all of these
things, socialism, communism, fascism,

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160
Nazism.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.360
All of these things are merely variants of
collectivism.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.040
That is the philosophy based on the assumption
that the group is more important than the

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.600
individual, and that the individual must be
sacrificed, if necessary, for the greater

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.560
good of the greater number.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.560
That's the trick.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.160
You're doing this for society.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.120
Obviously, you don't like to tell people what to
do.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.840
But sometimes for the good of society, that's
necessary.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.200
We have to start doing things for the greater good
of society, and not for idiots who think

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.520
that they can do their own research.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.040
It's not about me and my rights to choose.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.760
It's about how I love my neighbor.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.160
You are not doing this for yourself.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.460
If you are at all like me, your own health, your
own risk, is not a big rational driver

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.320
of all of your actions.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.440
They trick us into thinking that if you act in
your own self-interest, that somehow you

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.600
are selfish.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.960
And nothing could be further from the truth.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.000
Those of us who have discovered this trick long
ago, we realize that enlightened self-interest

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.440
comes into play.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.200
If you are acting out of self-interest, you soon
discover that the best way to benefit

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.200
yourself is to help other people.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.520
It does come back.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.360
The question is, how do we turn this ship around?

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:50.440
I think that the path to political hell in America
has been voting for the lesser of

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.720
two evils.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.680
They create conflict because conflict creates fear
and confusion.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.240
And out of that chaos, people are not too
analytical.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.840
They'll just struggle for some quick answer, which
is who you're going to vote for.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:06.600
That's usually the answer that's offered to them.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.440
They think that if you just vote for somebody, the
right person, everything will go away.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.760
You cannot wait until there's a list of candidates
that's published and you say,

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.120
hmm, which one am I going to choose?

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.360
By that time, the game is over.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.480
All those candidates have been selected before you
were even aware.

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.800
You've got to get into politics at the local level
so you have some influence in which

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.520
candidates are selected.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.000
And that starts at the grassroots level.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.600
You don't come in at the top, you come in at the
bottom.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.600
If we do that job, we will influence both
political parties just like our opponents do now.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.320
There is actually a way forward and a way out.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.480
But it's going to require work, and it's also
going to require that we acknowledge

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.080
that we have wronged ourselves, that we are part
of this problem.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.760
It's not the government that caused this.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.980
The government facilitated it.

01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.640
What caused it was our being asleep at the wheel.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.960
Without taking accountability, we cannot move
forward.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:14.080
The masses of humanity have been slapped awake in
a very short period of time to where now

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.040
it has created a domino effect of awareness all
across the planet.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.360
People cannot go back into the matrix now.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.360
They can't.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.040
A lot of people are trying to, and they can't.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.240
We have the right as citizens in this country to
abolish a government and create a new one.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.400
And that is the authority that has been given to
us.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.480
It is written in our documents, the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution of the United

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.400
States, the Declaration of Human Rights.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:46.320
We have indelible rights, and the basis of those
rights are our freedoms.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.840
And if we don't have that, we don't have life.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.320
And so we have to awaken, we have to arise, we
have to fight.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.160
The natural rights of every individual is life,
liberty, and property.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.600
And establishing a country on a premise that had
never been established before, that the

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.760
individual is sovereign because their rights are
endowed to them by a sovereign God.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:16.760
This which has happened can only be described as
divine, which is why we're the nation,

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:23.880
our ideology, our way of life is always under this
relentless attack that we have defeated

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.800
over and over again, and we will defeat it this
time.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.600
We're all fighting with each other, and the way
that we combat that is doing the opposite

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.680
of what these war overlords want us to do, which
is fight with each other.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:44.540
We should be learning how to forgive and inviting
other people to the table, even if we disagree

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:50.760
with them, and extending grace to one another,
even if we know that they've done something

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:56.400
that we totally disagree with, because that's how
we ultimately are going to heal as a nation,

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:02.440
is understanding that we all come from different
walks of life, and we all live here together,

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.320
and let's start talking.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:09.160
The only real problem that's existed in the world,
it's division.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.320
It's that people are not getting in rooms, willing
to speak with one another, see each

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:17.760
other's hearts, and get to know, hey, what do you
believe, what do I believe, and is

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.200
there a way we can actually work together to solve
these problems?

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.680
And I'm willing to bet that most of the Gen Zers
would say yes.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.360
That's what we need to do right now, and that's
why I'm glad we're the age that we are, because

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.600
we can be leaders of that conversation.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:38.400
When I started to realize, like, wow, freedom's a
polarizing concept for some reason, I thought

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.400
this was America.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.400
Is this America?

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400
It is?

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400
Okay.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.640
The world's different than I thought.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:50.560
So my fear was, I could lose everything, I could
lose my audience, I could lose my business,

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.160
but I knew, especially having a son come into the
world, I am imprinting something on his

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.120
beautiful, innocent, fragile psyche and heart.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:06.280
I'm imprinting the man that I am, or I'm
imprinting a hollow shell of the man that I refuse
to

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.280
be.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:13.000
And I knew in that moment, I'm willing to risk
losing everything to do that.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.880
I would rather pick up cans on the side of the
highway to feed my family than to live

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.200
out of alignment with my truth and betray my son.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.560
Just say no.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.640
Rise up in a non-violent way.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:34.120
They can't imprison everyone, they can't fire
everyone, but they can fire individuals that

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:38.400
are separated and don't work together and give in
to the fear.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.280
Don't sacrifice your future for a few conveniences
now in the present.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:48.600
You should sacrifice maybe the present
conveniences so that you're going to have a
future.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:55.880
The media has done a good job at stripping from us
our ability to think on our own and

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.880
for ourselves.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:02.360
If we can get back to that, I think that we can
build a stronger America.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:08.800
In my opinion, the first step you have to take is
you have to get out from under the

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.200
control mechanisms.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:19.200
And that means blow up your TV, don't listen to
the fear porn, and set yourself free of

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.400
debt, which is what controls you and controls
everything around you.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.600
It is the weapon that is used.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:33.600
The most important thing is always that the
dissonant voices continue to speak out and

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:40.480
also extremely important that they don't start to
form a mass or a crowd themselves.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.640
Because that happens very easily as well, happens
very easily.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.720
Once a large scale mass formation starts, the
people who do not go along with them feel

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.120
threatened and they can start to form a mass
themselves.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.200
So it's extremely important not to form a mass
ourselves.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:02.400
It means to form a group, a coherent group, and
that what unifies this group should in

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.400
the first place be the fact that everybody who
belongs to the group can have his own

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.720
opinion and can speak in his own way.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:22.160
What matters most to you?

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:27.880
I think what matters most to me is freedom,
freedom.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.360
I want as little laws as necessary to keep us from
killing each other.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.240
I mean, I get it, there's crazy people out there.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.320
We have to find a balance.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:44.800
In the end, I want my children to live in a world
where they're free, to dream, to take

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.680
risks, to fail, to succeed.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.040
Hardship strengthens us.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:59.160
We wouldn't have had the American Revolution and
the beta model for the American Constitution,

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.620
the beta model of a republic in the modern world,
unless the tyranny of King George had

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.400
been unbearable.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.440
All the good things in life usually are a result
of some kind of a rebound against something

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.800
that's very not good at all, very painful.

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.480
I mean, I think about if someone had jumped in
there and taken away my failures.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:25.800
I can't do what I'm doing now if someone had kept
me from really hurting, really learning

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.840
lessons that were hard to learn so that I would
never make that mistake again.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.640
In a philosophical sense, we should be thankful
for this movement that's happening, in spite

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.520
of the fact that it's tragedy and it's hurting
people and all that, but without it, we might

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.640
just go right along in that pot and be boiled in
time.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.360
But now the frog is jumping out, and we have a
chance coming up here now to create a new

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.880
vision and it's going to be great.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:58.540
It's a bit cynical, but it is in the end good news
that mass formation and totalitarianism

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:02.240
always destroys itself in a relatively short time
span.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.960
And the most important thing, of course, is that
you have to make sure that the system

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.840
does not destroy you before it destroys itself.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:15.800
Without history, it was always the very small
minority.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.920
History has always been written by the 1% of the
population.

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:27.760
15% of the population create history, and they
follow the thought leadership of 1%.

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.080
But that 15% altogether is what changes history.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.760
And so all we have to do is reach 15% of the
population.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.000
I think today, after all this time, we have more
than 15%.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
We just have to get them together so they realize
that they're not alone.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.240
And that's our task right now.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:54.600
I don't think our societies have taken the moment
to look up and actually see and appreciate

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.800
how much progress has been made in the past
century.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.600
On so many different levels, we have made
incredible progress.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.960
Like what we've got here is actually great.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.860
It's imperfect, and we should still be making
tweaks carefully to try to make it better.

01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:14.800
And I think that's where so much of that
self-hatred or hatred of the nation or hatred of
the other

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.880
or whatever comes from, this lack of perspective
and gratitude and inability to take a moment,

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:28.000
chill out on the activism, and go, wait, actually,
okay, we've achieved a very unique and special

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.800
point in history, and let's be careful with that.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:37.040
On that note, as a man who's traveled the world,
have you experienced any nation that

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.360
has course-corrected beyond their sins more than
the U.S. has?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360
No.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:51.440
It's sad to see Americans who live in a free
country born as Americans and do not recognize

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440
their privileges.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:37:00.680
You are born American, a free country, you never
suffered a starvation, and you need

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:07.480
to go to other countries to find out why all the
immigrants, millions and millions of them

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.320
want to come here.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:19.200
What is happening in our backyard today, I
experienced as an 11-year-old.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:34.480
I remember vividly all the promises that a guy
named Castro gave on how 99% of the people

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.480
swallow the pill.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:42.040
He was going to save Cuba.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:50.560
I remember how he promised to the farmers, to the
Guajiros, that you're going to own

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.680
the land.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:02.840
I remember all the promises that we hear today
about free education and free health care

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:13.120
and free land, and my God, no freedom.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:19.680
The defectors here that are speaking out against
the Communist Party in China are risking their

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.920
lives and our government is not interested in
listening to them or helping them in any

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:39.880
way.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.320
I have been in America for 10 years.

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:49.880
I saw a lot of Americans with wonderful hearts.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.960
America is a beacon of freedom.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:02.160
I'm happy living in this land to practice my
religion and to have a peaceful life.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.760
That's my hope.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.720
America is the last stand on earth for freedom.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:18.440
If we lose this country, the world will be a very
dark place.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.720
I have three children in this country.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:30.080
I want to protect their American dream, so here I
am, you know.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.280
I've noticed that every time you speak about
America, your eyes fill with tears.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:42.840
I do, I do love this country.

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.600
No place to go.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.000
And I just hope people can hear my stories.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.640
For past five years, I've been telling the same
thing.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.840
I have no political agenda here.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:05.360
I just want to live American dream and my children
live American dream.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:13.840
Sorry about that.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.080
It's time to ask questions.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:31.520
It's time to wake up.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.160
We've been brought together in this moment to face
the urgent choice between dehumanization

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.360
and re-humanization.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.240
Dehumanization requires us to do nothing, nothing
other than to allow that process to

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.360
continue to the point of no return.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:57.000
Re-humanization, on the other hand, requires
action, one action, to remember, to remember

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.680
what we knew as children when everything was
possible, before our attention was captured,

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:11.040
before the conditioning set in, before our nature
was denied.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:19.680
There's nothing new we have to learn, all we have
to do is to remember.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:29.600
And then take the hand of that memory and go out
and stand on ground, not concrete,

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:39.040
not asphalt, stand on ground and see if you can
feel the heartbeat of a universe that

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:54.920
conspired to give you life, so you once again can
feel the joy of being completely human

01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:03.160
and then never forget that moment.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.000
This is the moment for us to activate our innate
ability to create solutions that can

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.120
only happen through the awareness of symbiosis,
defined as a mutually beneficial relationship

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.560
between different groups.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.280
All of life depends on relationships.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.240
Every living thing is in communication, from the
stars to the planets, the earth, the plants,

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.560
the elements, the insects, the animals, the
humans, and every cell within us.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.140
Real change out there begins with real change
inside.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:43.280
As Americans today, we are truly a privileged
people in a privileged land.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:49.760
But with our blessings come responsibilities, and
with responsibilities come risks.

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.840
The challenge of our time is that we must accept
both the responsibilities of our blessings

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.960
and the risks involved in defending them for
ourselves and for future generations, and

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:07.160
we must do this without hesitation if we are to be
worthy benefactors of that precious heritage

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:13.960
of freedom passed on to us through the epic
sacrifices of those who have gone before.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:20.440
Now, that is not flag-waving, and it is not
cliched patriotism.

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:26.880
That's a simple statement of the obligations of
citizenship in this glorious land, our

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.360
land, which, with God's help, we shall preserve.
